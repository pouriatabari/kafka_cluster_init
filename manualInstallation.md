# kafka install cluster on 3 node
This document is based on the how to running a Kafka cluster on 3 node on different hosts.
## Step-1: Running Cluster
For this guide we running 3 nodes with name kafka-01, kafka-02, kafka-03 with the following IP-Address:
>- 192.168.27.201  kafka-01
>- 192.168.27.202  kafka-02
>- 192.168.27.203  kafka-03

1. At the first you need to open ports on OS firewall (for each node):
```
firewall-cmd --add-port={2181,9091,9092,9093,2888,3888}/tcp --permanent && firewall-cmd --reload
```
2. After that, you must installing java on your system (for each node):
```
yum install java java-devel
```
3. You can now added the following line at the `/etc/hosts` file (for each node):
```
cat <<EOF>> /etc/hosts
192.168.27.201  kafka-01
192.168.27.202  kafka-02
192.168.27.203  kafka-03
EOF
```
4. After that you need to install necessary packages for OS and update them (for each node):
```
yum -y install epel-release wget vim git curl net-tools yum-utils telnet && yum -y update
```
5. After that you need to download the latest kafka binary file from the server (for each node):
```
 wget https://downloads.apache.org/kafka/3.3.2/kafka_2.13-3.3.2.tgz
```
6. after that, decompress downloaded file and change the name of the directory to kafka(for each node):
```
tar -xvf kafka_*.tgz
rm -f kafka_*.tgz
mv -v kafka_* kafka
```
7. go to the directory and create the data directory for zookeeper (for each node):
```
cd kafka
mkdir -p data/zookeeper
```
8. change the value of the following keys into the config/zookeeper.properties file:
- for node 1 (192.168.27.201):
```

9. Different echo lines can be made on each node:
- node 1 `(192.168.27.201)`:
```
echo '1' >> data/zookeeper/myid
```
- node 2 `(192.168.27.202)`:
```
echo '2' >> data/zookeeper/myid
```
- node 3 `(192.168.27.203)`:
```
echo '3' >> data/zookeeper/myid
```
10. craete user for broker and zookeeper on each node:
```
useradd -m kafka -s /usr/sbin/nologin
useradd -m zookeeper -s /usr/sbin/nologin
```
11. config file for brokers, so the name of `config/server.properties`:

#    2. Latency: Very large flush intervals may lead to latency spikes when the flush does occur as there will be a lot of data to flush.
#    3. Throughput: The flush is generally the most expensive operation, and a small flush interval may lead to excessive seeks.

# A size-based retention policy for logs. Segments are pruned from the log unless the remaining
# segments drop below log.retention.bytes. Functions independently of log.retention.hours.

# The default value for this is 3 seconds.
# We override this to 0 here as it makes for a better out-of-the-box experience for development and testing.

12. Start the zookepeeper and servers(brokers):
```
./bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh -daemon config/zookeeper.properties
./bin/kafka-server-start.sh -daemon config/server.properties
```
13. you can check the running cluster by typing `jps` command. after that you must see 2 parameters in the output. `QuorumPeerMain` for ensure that running cluster and `kafka` for ensure that running brokers:
```
jps
```
## Step-2: Create Systemd File For Handling Service

## Step-3: Create Topic
1. Create a Topic in one of the nodes( for example node-1(kafka-01) ):
```
./bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --topic test-01 --bootstrap-server 192.168.27.201:9091 --partitions 3 --replication-factor 2
```
>note:
>- `partitions` lets you decide how many brokers you want your data to be split between. Since we set up 3 brokers, we can set this option to 3.
>- `replication-factor` describes how many copies of you data you want (in case one of the brokers goes down, you still have your data on the others). Since we set >this value to 2, our data will have two copies of itself on any two of the brokers.
>- `bootstrap-server` points to the address of any one of our active Kafka brokers. Since all brokers know about each other through Zookeeper, it doesn’t matter which >one you choose.
2. You can see list of available topic:
```
./bin/kafka-topics.sh --list --bootstrap-server kafka-01:9091
```
3. You can see details about a specific topic:

```
./bin/kafka-topics.sh --describe --topic test-01 --bootstrap-server kafka-01:9091

```

## Step-4: Create Producer And Send Message To Kafka Cluster
1. Create producer:
```
./bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --bootstrap-server kafka-01:9091 --topic test-01
```
>after you insert aboce command in the CLI, you can write the message as producer. after that you must create the consumer by the following command.

## Step-5: Create Consumer and recieving Messages
2. Create consumer and see the message:
```
./bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server kafka-01:9091 --topic test-01 --formatter kafka.tools.DefaultMessageFormatter --property print.timestamp=true --property print.key=true --property print.value=true --from-beginning
```
or 
```
./bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server kafka-01:9091 --topic test-01 --from-beginning
```
